            <h3>Brief History</h3>
            Hello! My name is Shelby De Oliveira Cignetti. I am a student at
            Georgia Tech Bootcamp for Coding. I have a Bachelorâ€™s in Fine Arts.
            I have a cat name Mimikyu and she was a stray. I was born in
            Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where I lived in Latrobe, Pennsylvania
            until 2002. Then I moved to the Golden Isles in Southeast Georgia.
            Then in 2010, I moved to Atlanta for college. In my free time, I
            like to play videogames, hike, rock climbing, and volunteer at
            Dragoncon and Momocon.

            my passion for technology and excellent communication skills to

            legacy services. I am a team player with good communication skills
